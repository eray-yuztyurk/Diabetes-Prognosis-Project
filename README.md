# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Business Problem
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether individuals have diabetes based on their features. The model will utilize data collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in the United States.

## Dataset Story
The dataset consists of data collected from Pima Indian women aged 21 and older living in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. It includes various features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, age, and the presence or absence of diabetes as the target variable.

## Project Tasks
The project involves several key tasks:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Examining the big picture of the dataset
   - Identifying numerical and categorical variables
   - Analyzing numerical and categorical variables
   - Conducting target variable analysis
   - Performing outlier analysis
   - Performing missing data analysis
   - Performing correlation analysis
2. Feature Engineering
   - Performing necessary operations for missing and outlier values
   - Creating new variables
   - Performing encoding operations
   - Standardizing numerical variables
3. Modelling
   - Implementing machine learning models:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors Model
     - RandomForestClassifier Model
